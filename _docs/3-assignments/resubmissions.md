#### What assignments can I resubmit?
You may resubmit **deep dives** and **labs** only.

#### How do I resubmit?
For Labs
: If you did not fully or correctly complete your lab assignment during your lab section, you may get it checked off during hours **the week of** the lab. If you missed your scheduled lab section, you cannot make up that assignment.

For Deep Dives
: If you did not fully or correctly complete your deep dive assignment by the due date, you may submit a "Regrade Request" through Gradescope. If you missed the deadline for a deep dive, you cannot make up that assignment. To submit a regrade request you must answer:
1. How you identified your mistakes (how did you know where it was)
2. How you fixed your mistakes (what did you change and **why**? How do you know it was fixed?)

#### What's the deadline for resubmitting?
For Labs
: You have **until Friday, end of hours** of the week lab was held to get your lab checked off for a higher level of knowledge.

For Deep Dives
: You have until **Thursday, April 29th @ 3:30pm** (one week after classes end) to resubmit any deep dive.
